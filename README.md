# Huffman-Coding
This is a Java tool for compressing and decompressing text files in UTF-16 using Huffman Coding.
It generates a binary file which can be decompressed into the original using the same tool.
More charsets will be added soon, perhaps along with support for different file types.


### Usage:  
```cmd
java -jar HuffmanCoding.jar <option> <input_file> <output_file>
```

  Options:  
  - [-e] Encode
  - [-d] Decode
